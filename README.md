This is an Encrytion and decrytion Playfair Cipher bulit by myself for a crytopgraphy class
Ex: Plain text: TENNIS, Key = ABOUT 

Step 1: Write out key in 5x5 grid and fill out the remaining letter  

Step 2: split TENNIS into pairs of 2   

TE NX NI SX  

If duplicate letters, then separate and put X 

If the last letter by itself put X  

Step 3: to convert TE draw a box around the letters with them at the corners 

If not in the same column or row, then swap the corners   

TE = OG   

NX = QV  

NI = PH  

SX = QZ 

EX: Plaintext: HOBBIT, Key = RON  

Cipher text = JR NZ MO SY  

Plaintext: BILBO, Key = Ring, BI LB OX 

Ciphertext = CR HD LZ   

Ciphertext: TASTE, Key = EAT, TA ST EX 

Plaintext = BTRBTV 

If in same row (horizontal) shift to the right, Else Column shift down or if cipher to plaintext shift up and left
